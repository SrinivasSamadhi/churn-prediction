# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction App

This project is a **Machine Learning web application** built with **Streamlit** that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on their information. The model is trained using a neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Predict customer churn probability in real-time
- ✅ Clean and intuitive Streamlit user interface
- ✅ Model trained on preprocessed customer data using TensorFlow
- ✅ Scaler and model persistence using `joblib` and `.keras` formats

---

## 🧠 Model Info

- Framework: `TensorFlow / Keras`
- Preprocessing: `StandardScaler` from `scikit-learn`
- Model Type: `Sequential` Neural Network with:
  - Dense(64) → Dense(32) → Dense(1, sigmoid)

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/srinivassamadhi/churn-prediction.git
cd churn-prediction
```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```

3. **Install the required libraries**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🖥️ Run the App

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Your browser will automatically open `http://localhost:8501`.

---

## 📥 Input Format (Sample)
You’ll be prompted to enter the following details:

- Credit Score
- Geography
- Gender
- Age
- Tenure
- Balance
- Number of Products
- Has Credit Card
- Is Active Member
- Estimated Salary
- Exited (0 or 1) → for testing

After submission, the model will return whether the customer is likely to **churn or stay**.

---

## ✅ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- See `requirements.txt`:
  ```
  streamlit
  numpy
  pandas
  joblib
  scikit-learn
  tensorflow
  ```

---

## 📌 Notes

- Make sure `model.h5` and `scaler.pkl` are generated by training the model in `churn_prediction.ipynb`.
- These files must be placed in the **same directory** as `streamlit_app.py`.
